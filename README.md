> **"Writing code is only half the battle; understanding it is the other half."**

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and engineering handbook. It contains structured notes, technical deep-dives, and "Today I Learned" (TIL) logs covering frontend development, system design, and algorithms.

## 📂 Structure
The journal is organized by domain to ensure easy navigation and long-term utility:

* **`/css`** - Layouts, Box Model, Animations, and Architecture.
* **`/javascript`** - Core concepts (Closures, Promises, Event Loop), ES6+, and Design Patterns.
* **`/react`** - Hooks, Lifecycle methods, State Management, and Performance.
* **`/dsa`** - Data Structures, Algorithms, and Problem Solving patterns.
* **`/system-design`** - Architecture, Networking, and Scalability notes.

## 📅 Recent Entries

## 🚀 Goals
* **Consistency:** Commit regular summaries of concepts learned during study sessions.
* **Clarity:** Translate complex topics into simple, interview-ready explanations.
* **Retention:** Use "Active Recall" by writing documentation from memory.
